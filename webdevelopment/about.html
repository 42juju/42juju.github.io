      <h1> Julian Stevens </h1>
      <h3> Thanks you visting my page!</h3>

      <p>
        Hello! This is my <em>introduction</em> to myself. Who is Julian Stevens? I am a junior at the University of Missouri, currently studying informational technology, with an emphasis on cyber security. 
        I have always been interested in technology, but this <em>emphasis</em> comes from my desire to be ahead of the curve when AI robots take over the world. This was I will be able to help save human kind. Aside from my academic and paranoia, I am a active member of the Universities baseball team. When choosing a school to go to, I have multiple options and would often lose sleep trying to decide where I should end up. Making the wrong decision could cause my athletic career to come to a screeching halt. It ultimately came down to the competitiveness of the conference that Missouri was in.
        It was definitely not because of the gorgeous weather that we experience.
