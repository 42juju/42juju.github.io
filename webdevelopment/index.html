       <p>The purpose or goal of this website is to provide the user a sense of relief from their busy lives with sports and school work.  
        My goal is to create a database that has videos, examples, and motivation to help aid you in balancing school, social life, and athletics. 
        Is my website catered to student athletes such as myself? Yes, and no. I believe that everyone can benefit from mental wellness and having 
        a place where they can get examples for their studies. Let me go over the layout. There will be a page for wisdom from credited authors as 
        well as a forum for people to add their own. A page for video references. Such as a form for baseball swings, or a workout that could benefit you.  And on the last page you will be able to see references for code. There could be useful links etc. A truely one stop shop.  </p>
